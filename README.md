An application to support the GDS ['Break Into Public Speaking' course](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/06/21/breaking-in-a-new-generation-of-public-speakers/). 

Currently WIP

This application will be a place that GDS colleagues can go to find and post about: 
- learning resources about public speaking
- CFPs (upcoming speaking opportunities)
- Database of people from GDS/Government that would like to speak at events and their areas of expertise

Possible extensions
- Extend it to be a place where people can post about upcoming tech meet ups that are happening either internally or nearby
- Extend to give advice about how to run events at GDS
- A place to submit ideas to the Diversity Working Group
